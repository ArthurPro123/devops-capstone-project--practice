# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE MAPPINGS 
#
# The environment variables defined in the selected .env file (specified in the Makefile) 
# are mapped to the MySQL service in 'docker-compose.yml' as follows:
#
#    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Gets its value from ${DB_ROOT_PASS}
#    - MYSQL_DATABASE:      Gets its value from ${DB_NAME}
#    - MYSQL_USER:          Gets its value from ${DB_USER}
#    - MYSQL_PASSWORD:      Gets its value from ${DB_PASS}
#
#
# Additionally, the following variables are used for persistent storage and port mapping:
#
# - MYSQL_VOLUME: Set to './mysql_data' in the .env file, 
#   it creates a persistent volume for MySQL data storage 
#   by mapping to the container's '/var/lib/mysql'.
#
# - MYSQL_PORT:   Set to 3306 in the .env file, it exposes 
#   MySQL on port 3306 of the host by mapping to the 
#   container's default MySQL port (3306).
#
# This mapping allows for dynamic configuration of the MySQL service based on the
# environment specified when running the Makefile targets.
